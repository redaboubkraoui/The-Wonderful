        <h1>Shelter Dog Hugs News Reporter Until He Decides To Adopt Her</h1>
        <img style="width:100%;height:auto;" src="3381.jpeg">
        A news reporter recently went to an animal shelter to do a story for his magazine, but little did he know that he would get swept up in a sweet story and was about to find a new family member.

The reporter was walking around the shelter when a very special dog approached him. While many of the shelter dogs were watching him out of curiosity, this one walked up to him without any fear or shyness. The dog surprised everyone by hugging the reporter and showering him with all of her affection.

At first, the reporter was confused by the dog’s actions, but her hug was so heartfelt that he happily hugged her and encouraged her behavior.

He gently petted the dog and rewarded her with cuddles, causing her to cling to him more. The dog clung onto his leg tightly, hugged him, and didn’t let him go. It is clear that the poor pup is tired of being at the shelter alone, so she loves to be hugged and cuddled by someone.

People standing nearby couldn’t resist the heartwarming interaction between the journalist and the dog, so they began recording it. The short video clip posted to Reddit and quickly went viral.

Redditor NeniuDormo, who posted the video clip, described it as follows: “Covering a story at an animal shelter, a journalist was grabbed by this dog and wouldn’t let go.”
<h3>Watch the adorable video below:</h3>

In this video clip, the dog is seen standing up on his back legs and curling up to the man. It seemed like the pup had found her soulmate, so she refused to let go of the reporter.

The sweet dog captured the reporter’s heart, so he decided to adopt her and gave her a loving forever home. We are happy to know that the dog now lives happily with her owner who she loves so much.
