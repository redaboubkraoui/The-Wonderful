        <strong>That’s called being at the right place at the right time!</strong>
He was very smart about getting on the boat he went around the back where it was lower to get in. I think that’s not his first time he has been escaping an orca or shark.

Donellas, who works with an Alaskan exploration company and provides area boat trips. He was out on his boat when he saw a commotion taking place in the water. He realized something was rapidly swimming closer and closer to his boat to avoid being e.at.en by a k.i.ller whale. The whale’s dorsal fin can be seen closing in as an otter hurriedly tries to avoid being k.i.lled.

The otter pops up out of the water and takes refuge on the boat with Donellas, who cannot believe what he is seeing.
For the next several minutes, the otter stays safely aboard the boat as the k.i.ller whale circles his prey. At one point, the otter goes back into the water and then changes his mind in favor of the boat.

<strong>Glad he found a safe place to hide &#x1f970; What an intelligent Otter!</strong>

The very close encounter lasted a while, as the otter eventually plunged back into the water once the [k.i.ller whale] distanced himself from the boat.

<strong>Clever otter well done safely on board!</strong>

The look on his little face is like right on dude that was close &#x1f605;

<strong>Well done for saving this otters life &#x1f44f;</strong>
God &#x1f64f; bless that fisherman for helping that little otter. &#x1f64f;&#x1f64f;&#x1f64f;
