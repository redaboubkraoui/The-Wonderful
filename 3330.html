        <h2>In Siberia, Russia, the winter can bring serious frosts capable of putting the lives of both people and animals at risk.</h2>
This is the story of a cat named “Dymka” (from its Russian translation of ‘fog’) that was a victim of the cold weather lashing of Russia, and due to it she lost her arm or legs. Fortunately, thanks to advancements in modern technology and the provision of big-hearted veterinarians, she had the ability to walk once again

According to what is claimed, this cat was found by a driver in the cold roads of Novokuznetsk in Siberia. The man seeking to help this poor animal took her to the Novosibirsk clinic situated in the city of the same name. There, it was located that Dymka struggled with frostbite on both her limbs, her tail and her ears, after having been subjected to the ruthless Siberian cold for a long time.

<h2>The pros went to work to make Dymka walk again.</h2>
Because the problem in which the cat reached the clinic, it was required to amputate her front and rear legs. However, the professionals of the clinic where Dymka was received, got down to work together with the researchers of the TPU (Tomsk Polytechnic College) to develop the 4-year-old feline, a titanium prosthesis that would allow her to return to lead a normal life.

It was thus that, after using state-of-the-art technology, such as CT scans of Dymka’s paws, and using calcium phosphate together with the 3D-printed titanium implants (which were combined with the cat’s leg bones), they were able to place the first implants in her front legs successfully and later on they did it in her back legs.

After greater than six months of this important treatment, it can currently be seen just how Dymka had the ability to regain nearly complete movement with her titanium legs. In a video shared on YouTube by the clinic that treated the cat’s case, the feline can be seen stretching, walking and also playing as if she had never ever lost her arm or legs, her titanium legs being flexible and with a black textured background.

It must be noted that until now Dymka has been the 2nd cat in the world that has undergone a treatment such as this. The first was performed in 2016 on a cat named Ryzhik (red), who after losing her limbs underwent this surgery to restore movement.

During the cold weather snowfalls in winter, lots of pet cats and other pets reveal situations of frostbite in the cities of Siberia. Frostbite occurs when the extreme cold of winter freezes the skin and internal tissues, usually the extremities, in some cases causing the death of claimed tissues, and forcing their amputation to conserve life.

If you have pets and you live in a location where there are extremely cold seasons, attempt to take all the required care to prevent them from being exposed to situations as dangerous to their lives as this one.
