<strong>It takes a lot of courage to even be around apolor bear. Even if he swam with it they are still wild animals.</strong>
That’s so amazing but a little sc.ary glad the bear really likes and trust you!

Mark Dumas, is taking pet ownership to totally new heights.
Polar bears are magnificent and iconic creatures. They are among one of the most beloved animals in the world, as well as lots of people are working hard to assure that they live as well as prosper in the wild.

One more interesting truth regarding polar bears is that they are not white in any way. They have light-reflecting clear hair that makes them look like white as snow. Due to the fact that their skin is basically coal black, this helps them blend in with their environment.

Mark isn’t just the globe’s only man swimming with a polar bear; he’s also the world’s only 60-year-old man swimming with a polar bear. And it so takes place that polar bear is his continuous buddy.

Agee, Mark’s 16-year-old polar bear who evaluates 800 extra pounds, delights in routine dives in Mark’s pool. Agee is kissed, hugged, and also battled by Mark. He also sinks his head right into her massive paws. Mark is a polar bear trainer from Abbotsford, British Columbia, that has actually worked with animals for over 40 years.

Mark claims that he can check out Agee and determine just how to interact with her securely. He is aware that she is in charge, and also he complies with her instructions.

That’s the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen&#x2764;&#x2764;&#x2764; Agee is happy, well cared for , and has all the love she could ask for. Her dad running up to her, and she jumps into the pool is adorable. Like a affectionate, 800 pd. &#x2764;&#x2764;

Bears raised as babies imprint on humans and after a while, can’t be released except put in a zoo or wildlife park, geese are the same

<strong>Amazing so lucky to interact with this beautiful girl! Rare &amp; wonderful!! A privilege for both!&#x1f9e1;</strong>
Good luck and bless him…! &#x1f64f;&#x1f64f;&#x1f64f;
