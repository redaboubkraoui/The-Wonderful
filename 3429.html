        <strong>How cool! Animals adjust without a thought. This kitten will be a blessing. They can learn together. &#x1f919;&#x1f44c;</strong>
Such kindness and love is shared between them &#x1f64f;&#x2665;&#xfe0f;&#x1f90d; We think this little girl and her kitten’s lives are complete with each other…! &#x1f495;

Scarlette Tipton, now two-years-old, had her ‘left ar.m’ completely [am.puta.ted] because of can.cer when she was 10 months old; Doc, a rescue kitten, had [lo.st] her paw after she tried to sleep under the hood of a car to stay warm.

So on Christmas eve, the Tipton family, from California, went to the shelter. The two found each other on Christmas eve, after the Tipton family learned about the cat on TV. By Wednesday, Doc is adopted and was part of the family ever since…

Mom Scarlette share: We wanted a little kitten to have [Scarlette] grow up with, so she has something that’s just like her. She did notice that Doc had staples on her side and said ow.ies. I let her know that she had owi.es just like her, and she placed her hand on her side and just nodded.
She recognizes that the cat has similar struggles as she does.

So glad they found each other. The kitten will help that little girl in ways that no one else can.
Thank you for giving the kitty a forever loving home &#x2764;&#xfe0f;&#x1f3e1;
